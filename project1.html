                                            Many users cancel their doctor appointments due to choosing the wrong specialist. They struggle to identify the right doctor for their problem/symptom.

                                                        <ul>
                                                            <li><b>Understanding user needs</b> was the starting point of the design process. I conducted research to understand the needs and pain points of users, including both patients and doctors. This helped me to identify the core features and functionalities that needed to be incorporated into the app.</li>
                                                            <li><b>The importance of simplicity</b>  was a key takeaway from the app design process. I learned that it is important to keep the user interface simple and intuitive. A complex and cluttered design can be confusing and frustrating for users, especially older individuals who may not be tech-savvy.</li>
                                                            <li><b>Incorporating user feedback</b> was an essential part of the design process. I received regular feedback from users and made adjustments to the feature accordingly. This helped me to ensure that the feature was meeting their needs and expectations, and to make any necessary changes to improve the overall user experience.</li>
